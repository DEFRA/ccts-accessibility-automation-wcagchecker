# Accessibility Automation Solution - Discussion Points

## Questions & Answers

### Ben Sagar: Can we use the solution without automation, like crawling pages in a local environment on static pages?
- **Response:** Not possible at the moment. However, the team can cherry-pick tests from the regression suite to make it lean.

### How to optimize the volume of False Positive findings?
- We are focusing exclusively on A and AA-level issues, as they represent the most critical accessibility concerns requiring attention and resolution. Low-level suggestions that could negatively impact execution performance are being excluded. Regularly review false positive reports with teams to refine the testing approach and exclude common false triggers.
